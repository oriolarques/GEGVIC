\usage{
ic_score(
  tpm,
  metadata,
  response,
  compare = NULL,
  p_label = "p.format",
  colors = c("black", "orange")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tpm}{Output from the ic_raw_to_tpm function. This is a matrix
containing expression counts as TPM with HGNC gene symbols as rownames
and samples identifiers as colnames.}

\item{metadata}{Data frame that contains supporting variables to the data.}

\item{response}{Unquoted name of the variable indicating the groups to analyse.}

\item{compare}{A character string indicating which method to be used for
comparing means. Options are 't.test' and 'wilcox.test' for two groups or
'anova' and 'kruskal.test' for more groups. Default value is NULL.}

\item{p_label}{Character string specifying label type. Allowed values include
'p.signif' (shows the significance levels), 'p.format' (shows the formatted
p-value).}

\item{colors}{Character vector indicating the colors of the different groups
to compare. Default values are two: black and orange.}
}
\value{
Returns ggplot objects.

\description{
Calculates and plots immunophenogram (IPG) and immunophenoscores
(IPS) for each sample and each group of study.
